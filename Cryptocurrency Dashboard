How It Works ???

- The dashboard uses Chart.js for all visualizations

- Real-time updates are simulated with JavaScript intervals

- The UI is built with modern CSS (Flexbox and Grid)

- Portfolio values are calculated based on current prices and holdings

- The dashboard updates cryptocurrency prices every 10 seconds to simulate real-time data. You can easily connect this to actual cryptocurrency APIs like CoinGecko or Binance by replacing the simulated data with real API calls.
